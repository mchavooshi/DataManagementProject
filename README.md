# Data Management Project

This repository contains a project focusing on data management principles and techniques. The project involves selecting data, importing data, exploring data, and cleaning data. The project is organized into three main steps:

## Step 1: Import Data
- In this step, data is imported into the Jupyter Notebook environment for analysis.

## Step 2: Explore Data
- This step involves various methods to explore the imported data:
  1. Head and Tail Methods: Preview the first and last few rows of the dataset.
  2. Information Methods: Display information about the dataset, such as data types and column names.
  3. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical columns.
  4. Visualize Data: Create visualizations to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships.

## Step 3: Clean Data
- In this final step, data cleaning tasks are performed to ensure data quality:
  1. Data Type Problem: Address issues related to incorrect data types.
  2. Data Range Problem: Identify and handle data outside of expected ranges.
  3. Duplicate Data: Detect and remove duplicate entries from the dataset.
  4. Missing Data: Impute or remove missing values to ensure data completeness.

## Jupyter Notebook File
- The Jupyter Notebook file (Data_Management_Process.ipynb) contains the Python code implementing the aforementioned steps. It provides a detailed walkthrough of the data management process, including code snippets andÂ explanations.
